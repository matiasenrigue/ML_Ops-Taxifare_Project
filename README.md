# MLOps Project

- Creating a Python package with it's environment
- Getting Data from Google Cloud to train our model
- Constantly trainning our model and automating if it should be improved or not with MLflow and Prefect
- Creating an API with Fast API that receives an input and outputs a prediction made with our model
- Converting it in to a Docker image that runs in the cloud
- Having a frontend (STREAMLIT) to be able to interect with that API


## Back-end

- ML flow
- Prefect
- Docker
- FastAPI
- Google Cloud


## Front-end

- Streamlit

The Frontend is really poor and could have been done way better, but it was not the objective of the project
